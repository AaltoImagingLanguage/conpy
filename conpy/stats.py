    This is a variation on the cluster permutation test described in [1]_.

    First, connections are thresholded using a paired 2-sided t-test. Any
    connections that survive the threshold are grouped into "bundles". A bundle
    is a group of connections which start and end points are close together.
    Then, for each bundle, the sum of the t-values of its connections is
    evaluated against those obtained from using the same procedure on random
    permutations of the data. For further information, see [2]_.

    Parameters
    ----------
    cond1 : list of VertexConnectivity
        For each subject, the connectivity object corresponding to the first
        experimental condition. Each connectivity object should define the same
        connections.
    cond2 : list of VertexConnectivity
        For each subject, the connectivity object corresponding to the second
        experimental condition. Each connectivity object should define the same
        connections.
    cluster_threshold : float
        The threshold to use for forming the intial bundles. Only connections
        with a t-value that is either higher than ``cluster_threshold`` or
        lower than ``-cluster_threshold`` are kept.
    tail : -1 | 0 | 1
        Which "tail" of the distribution of the test statistic to use:

            -1: the hypothesis is that cond1 < cond2.
             0: the hypothesis is that cond1 != cond2.
             1: the hypothesis is that cond1 > cond2.

        Defaults to 0, meaning a two-tailed test.
    src : instance of SourceSpace
        The source space for which the connectivity is defined.
    alpha : float
        The p-value to use for null-hypothesis testing. Using random
        permutations, the distribution of t-values is estimated. Bundles with a
        t-value in the requested percentile will be deemed significant.
        Defaults to 0.05.
    n_permutations : int
        The number of random permutations to use to estimate the distribution
        of t-values. Defaults to 1024.
    max_spread : float
        Maximum amount the position (in metres) of the start and end points
        of the connections may vary in order for them to be considered part of
        the same "bundle". Defaults to 0.013.
    cluster_method : str
        Linkage method for fclusterdata. Defaults to 'single'. See
        documentation for ``scipy.cluster.hierarchy.fclusterdata`` for for more
        information.
    seed : int | None
        The seed to use for the random number generator. Use this to reproduce
        a specific result. Defaults to ``None`` so a different seed is used
        every time.
    return_details : bool
        Whether to return details about the bundles and the permulation stats.
        Defaults to False.
    n_jobs : int
        Number of jobs to run in parallel. Note that a copy of ``cond1`` and
        ``cond2`` will be made for each job in memory. Defaults to 1.
    verbose : bool | str | int | None
        If not ``None``, override default verbose level
        (see :func:`mne.verbose` and :ref:`Logging documentation <tut_logging>`
        for more).

    Returns
    -------
    connection_indices : ndarray, shape (n_connections,)
        Indices of the connections that are part of a significant bundle.
    bundles : list of list of int (optional)
        For each found bundle, the indices of the connections that are part of
        the bundle. Only returned when ``return_details=True`` is specified.
    bundle_ts : ndarray, shape (n_bundles,) (optional)
        For each found bundle, the sum of the t-values for all connections that
        are part of the bundle. These are the t-values that were used to
        determine the initial threshold for the connections. They are not
        indicative of the null-hypothesis.
        Only returned when ``return_details=True`` is specified.
    bundle_ps : ndarray, shape (n_bundles,) (optional)
        For each found bundle, the p-value based on the permutation test,
        indicative for the likelyhood that the null-hypothesis holds.
        Only returned when ``return_details=True`` is specified.
    H0 : ndarray, shape (n_permutations,) (optional)
        The maximum observed t-value during each random permutation.
        Only returned when ``return_details=True`` is specified.
